# SPIV-PLIF Analysis

Scripts and functions utilized to analyze a variety of fluid dynamic and mass transfer experiments as part of my PhD project. The measurements are performed with a setup combining SPIV (Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry) and PLIF (Planar Light Induced Fluorescence) for the investigation of velocity and concentration distribution in liquid films over flat and non-flat plates.
